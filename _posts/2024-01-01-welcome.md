This starter post is here to confirm that your new Jekyll site is wired up
correctly. Update or remove it once you begin publishing real content.

Key next steps:

1. Replace placeholder text in `_config.yml` with your real site metadata.
2. Adjust the navigation by editing `_data/navigation.yml`.
3. Add Markdown posts inside `_posts/` following the naming convention `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`. -->
