I’m a Data Engineer with a strong foundation in Python, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Docker, and cloud fundamentals—built on top of four years of analytical experience as a health pricing analyst. With a Master of Science in Data Science & Statistics and an AI engineering bootcamp, I’ve developed a hybrid skill set that spans data engineering, statistical reasoning, and modern AI systems. I specialize in building reliable data pipelines, working with contemporary data platforms, and supporting AI/LLM workflows end-to-end.

I’ve created production-style applications using Streamlit, worked extensively with LLMs (OpenAI, PydanticAI), experimented with AI agents, and deployed containerized solutions. This combination of data engineering expertise and applied AI experience makes me especially effective in environments where data infrastructure, machine learning, and AI product development intersect.
