I'm an **AI Engineer with a strong foundation in Data Science**, and I love building intelligent systems from data ingestion to deployed agents. My recent work focuses on **LLM agents, retrieval architectures (Qdrant + Elasticsearch), and containerized deployments with Docker**.

My latest project, the Habit Builder AI Agent, helps users build evidence-based habits by combining audio transcription with vector search and agent tool calls to help users build evidence-based habits. For the project, I used Docker to create all pertinent services, Faster-Whisper to transcribe audio files, PostgreSQL to store transcriptions, SentenceTransformers to embed transcript chunks, Qdrant/Elasticsearch to store vectors and their metadata, and the PydanticAI framework with OpenAI LLMs. I also evaluated the system with unit tests and an evaluation pipeline using an LLM judge. The agent can answer any question related to the archive about but not limited to sleep, physical performance, and productivity, as well as search the latest medical publications to provide information on recent research and recommend the most sound habits backed by science.

My path into technology was not linear. I studied Public Health but discovered a love for statistics. After working four years as a pricing analyst and completing a Master's in Data Science, I realized what I enjoyed most was transforming messy data into meaningful insights.

Graduate school taught me modeling techniques, but it didn't teach me how to build end-to-end products. That realization pushed me toward engineering: understanding ingestion, pipelines, storage, retrieval, reasoning, and deployment as a unified system.

Discovering agentic systems—beyond RAG — that can retrieve and take action was the turning point. I began studying LLM fundamentals before committing to mastering this technology by enrolling in Alexey Grigorev’s AI Bootcamp, where I learned how to build production-ready AI applications.

My Data Science background still plays a big role in how I think. Beyond modeling, I'm comfortable creating data collection pipelines using tools like Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and requests. For me, good AI systems start with good data, and I like understanding every layer of the pipeline.

I'm driven by curiosity, structured learning, and a desire to build AI tools that are genuinely useful. I enjoy projects that combine multiple layers—data ingestion, embeddings, retrieval, reasoning, logging, and deployment—into one cohesive, well-engineered product.

I'm currently looking for roles where I can contribute to **LLM engineering, agent systems, retrieval architecture — ideally on teams building intelligent automation or AI-powered products that solve real business problems.** If you're working on intelligent automation, agentic systems, or AI-powered workflows, I'd love to connect.
